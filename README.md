Lab 1: My first time using processing was quite the expirience, my previous expirience with coding was using html for web developmen, and jumping into processing was harder then I expected. Eventually I was about to figure out the ins and outs of processing and made a simple rectagular house because that was both theme of the week and the easiest thing to create.

Lab 2: For the second week of processing I had a some expirience, although I still had a lot to learn. The theme of that week was space and the main topic that was talked about were colors. I went with a very simplistic sketch,basically a bunch of planets floating about in different colors. [https://github.com/Gamelover999/gh-pages/blob/gh-pages/f17magd150lab02_quinn.pde]



Lab 3: The third assignment was all about math operations and variables, and at this point I was starting to get the hang of processing and was ready for some more advanced code. Once again it was a very simplistic sketch, although I got some help from youtuber Steve Dickie to make this assignment easier.

Lab 4: This week was about Dynamism, and for the assignment I did the same thing except I added some code to change to colors of the circles with a mouse click. [https://github.com/Gamelover999/gh-pages/blob/gh-pages/s17magd150lab04_quinn.pde]



Lab 5: The theme for this week was interaction, and for my assignment I made a television that when powered on would change to screen color. A common theme of my work is simplicity. [https://github.com/Gamelover999/gh-pages/blob/gh-pages/s17magd150lab05_quinn.pde]
